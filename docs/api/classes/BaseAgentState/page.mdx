# BaseAgentState

Base class for agent state with Pydantic validation.

Provides async context manager support for safe state access with automatic
persistence. Subclass this to define your agent's state schema.

Example:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class CounterState(BaseAgentState):
    count: int = 0

class CounterAgent(BaseAgent[CounterState]):
    STATE_MODEL = CounterState

    async def run_task(self, payload, id):
        async with self.state as s:
            s.count += 1
            return s.count
```
